# Overview
Welcome to the BWSI RACECAR course website! This page will outline the sections of this site and give you an idea of how the pages are organized.

### Curriculum
This section contains several teaching modules for organizing the material. Module 0 teaches how to connect to and interact with the car. Module 1 teaches how to control the car. Module 2 teaches how to do image processing with OpenCV. Module 3 teaches how to detect your enviornment with AR tags and maps. Module 4 introduces machine learning.

### Cheatsheets
This section contains several reference cards with useful commands and tips for various tools used in this course (i.e. a "cheatsheet"). While it is always useful to read the official documentation, these pages may help you figure out how to perform useful basic commands faster than the broader general purpose documentation.

### Setup 
This section contains information on how to build, install, and configure your vehicle. This serves primarily as a reference for others. As part of of the BWSI RACECAR class, you will be assigned a fully assembled, functional car. If during the class your car stops working, contact a TA.

### Resources
Contains a set of useful documentation for various tools and sensors. A good place to get some additional information!
