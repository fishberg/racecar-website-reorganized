## Option 2: Bloated Piece of Software

<font color="A0A0A0">Advantages: saves directly to local machine files (for the host, at least), looks fancy  
Disadvantages: gross and cluttered interface, confusing networking, becoming a minion of the Microsoft empire </font>

### Instructions for Everybody

2. Download/install/whatever the [Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare-pack) extension pack
	1. If you don’t already have a Microsoft or GitHub account that you don’t mind being spammed, create a garbage account with a garbage email. Save the username and password.
	2. If prompted, click "allow".

2. If necessary, sign in with your Microsoft or Git account.
3. When prompted, select the folder that holds your programs.

### Collaborator Instructions

## Option 3: DIY

<font color="FF0000"> **Whatever you do, you must be able to get all team members up and running such that they can see and edit code.** </font>  
Let us know if you have something really good.
